# Overview
I originally made a palindrome checker in Java, and I decided to port it over to C++ to help me learn the syntax of the language. The user enters a string, and it is run through a very fast algorithm to determine whether it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, then the user can print it in box form on the screen.
